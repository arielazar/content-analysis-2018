      "Meritocracy (merit, from Latin mereō, and -cracy, from Ancient Greek κράτος kratos \"strength, power\") is a political philosophy which holds that certain things, such as economic goods or power, should be vested in individuals on the basis of talent.[1] Advancement in such a system is based on performance, as measured through examination or demonstrated achievement.\n",

      "The \"most common definition of meritocracy conceptualizes merit in terms of tested competency and ability, and most likely, as measured by IQ or standardized achievement tests.\"[2] In government and other administrative systems, \"meritocracy\" refers to a system under which advancement within the system turns on \"merits\", like intelligence, credentials, and education. These are often determined through evaluations or examinations.[3]\n",
      "In a more general sense, meritocracy can refer to any form of evaluation based on achievement. Like \"utilitarian\" and \"pragmatic\", the word \"meritocratic\" has also developed a broader connotation, and is sometimes used to refer to any government run by \"a ruling or influential class of educated or able people.\"[4]\n"
